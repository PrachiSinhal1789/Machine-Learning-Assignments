    "1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It simply means training the machine with given set of data and making predictions for future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 1.Stock price prediction\n",
    "2. Climate predictions\n",
    "3. Population Characteristics\n",
    "4. Medical domain like vaccine testing on a given sample of people\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Labeled training data set is any data having one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine learning model can learn from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction , and association rule learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.either supervised learning (if the groups have known labels) or unsupervised learning (if there are no group labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Spam detection is a supervised learning problem because the labels are known (spam or no spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Online learning system is a learning system in which the machine learns as data is given in small streams continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Out-of-core learning system is a system that can handle data that cannot fit into your computer memory. It uses online learning system to feed data in small bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Learning algorithm that relies on a similarity measure to make predictions is instance-based algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Model parameter determines how a model will predict given a new instance; model usually has more than one parameter (i.e. slope of a linear model). Hyperparameter is a parameter for the learning algorithm, not of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Four main challenges in Machine Learning include overfitted model, underfitted model, missing data and treating outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.We get more data, implement a simpler model, or eliminate outliers or noise from the existing data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Test set is a set that you test your model (fit using training data) to see how it performs. Test set is necessary so that you can determine how good (or bad) your model performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Validation set is a set used to compare between different training models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The goal of dev-set is to rank the models in term of their accuracy and helps us decide which model to proceed further with. Using Dev set we rank all our models in terms of their accuracy and pick the best performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.If you tune hyperparameters using the test sets, then it may not perform well on the out-of-sample data because the model is tuned just for that specific set.\n"
