    "1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.\n",
    "Training a model simply means learning good values for all the weights and the bias from labeled examples. In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.According to the “No Free Lunch” theory, there is no one model that works best for every situation. Because the assumptions of a great model for one issue may not hold true for another, it is typical in machine learning to attempt many models to discover the one that performs best for a specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.K-fold Cross-Validation is when the dataset is split into a K number of folds and is used to evaluate the model's ability when given new data. K refers to the number of groups the data sample is split into. For example, if you see that the k-value is 5, we can call this a 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Bootstrap Sampling is a method that involves drawing of sample data repeatedly with replacement from a data source to estimate a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a classification model? Demonstrate how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.It basically tells you how much better your classifier is performing over the performance of a classifier that simply guesses at random according to the frequency of each class. Cohen's kappa is always less than or equal to 1. Values of 0 or less, indicate that the classifier is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Ensemble modeling is a process where multiple diverse models are created to predict an outcome, either by using many different modeling algorithms or using different training data sets. The ensemble model then aggregates the prediction of each base model and results in once final prediction for the unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a descriptive model's main purpose? Give examples of real-world problems that descriptive models were used to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment. It is generally used to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does, and how it does it. A geometric model or spatial model is a descriptive model that represents geometric and/or spatial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.There are 3 main metrics for model evaluation in regression:\n",
    "R Square/Adjusted R Square.\n",
    "Mean Square Error(MSE)/Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error(MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Distinguish :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive vs. predictive models- A descriptive model will exploit the past data that are stored in databases and provide you with the accurate report. In a Predictive model, it identifies patterns found in past and transactional data to find risks and future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model-Underfitting means that your model makes accurate, but initially incorrect predictions. In this case, train error is large and val/test error is large too. Overfitting means that your model makes not accurate predictions. In this case, train error is very small and val/test error is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation-Bootstrapping contains repeated elements in every subset. Bootstrapping relies on random sampling. Cross-validation does not rely on random sampling, just splitting the dataset into k unique subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Make quick notes on:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. LOOCV-LOOCV(Leave One Out Cross-Validation) is a type of cross-validation approach in which each observation is considered as the validation set and the rest (N-1) observations are considered as the training set. In LOOCV, fitting of the model is done and predicting using one observation validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. F-measurement-The F-measure of the system is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of its precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. The width of the silhouette-Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "             4. Receiver operating characteristic curve-An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate. False Positive Rate\n",
