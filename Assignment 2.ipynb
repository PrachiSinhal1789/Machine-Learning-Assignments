    "1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Human Learning Systems is an alternative approach to public management which embraces the complexity of the real world, and enables us to work effectively in that complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Contents Classical and operant conditioning Categories of learning and the problem of definition Representativeness of rote verbal learning Centrality of verbal learning Probability learning Evaluation of stimulus sampling theory Short-term memory and incidental learning Behavioral effects of instruction to learn.\n",
    "Linear regression, decision trees, random forest and support vector machines are some commonly used techniques that are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.\n",
    "Key Responsibilities:\n",
    "To research, modify, and apply data science and data analytics prototypes.\n",
    "To create and construct methods and plans for machine learning.\n",
    "Employing test findings to do statistical analysis and improve models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Reinforcement learning is all about gamifying the learning process. This type of machine learning uses a reward-penalty method to teach an AI system. If it makes the right move, it gets rewarded. If it makes a mistake, it receives a penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis representation. The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The goal of machine learning is often — though not always — to train a model on historical, labelled data (i.e., data for which the outcome is known) in order to predict the value of some quantity on the basis of a new data item for which the target value or classification is unknown.\n",
    " Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data.\n",
    " \n",
    "7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.voice search technology, image recognition, automated translation, self-driven cars, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The work of assigning a meaning to data occurs during the abstraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "Equations.\n",
    "Diagrams such as trees and graphs.\n",
    "Logical if/else rules.\n",
    "Groupings of data known as clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Generalization means giving consistent accuracy for different set of data.It is important as model should not give good accuracy for a given data set and poor accuracy for another data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Classification tries to find the decision boundary, which divides the dataset into different classes. Regression algorithms solve regression problems such as house price predictions and weather predictions.\n",
    "Regression helps predict a continuous quantity, classification predicts discrete class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Formulating a regression analysis helps you predict the effects of the independent variable on the dependent one. Example: we can say that age and height can be described using a linear regression model. Since a person's height increases as age increases, they have a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:\n",
    "i. Machine learning algorithms are used\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning. Other popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, business process automation (BPA) and Predictive maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Studying under supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.\n"
