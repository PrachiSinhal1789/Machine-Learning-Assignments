    "1. What are the key tasks that machine learning entails? What does data pre-processing imply?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A machine learning task is the type of prediction or inference being made, based on the problem or question that is being asked, and the available data. For example, the classification task assigns data to categories, and the clustering task groups data according to similarity.\n",
    "Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data to well-formed data sets so that data mining analytics can be applied. Raw data is often incomplete and has inconsistent formatting. The adequacy or inadequacy of data preparation has a direct correlation with the success of any project that involve data analyics.Preprocessing involves both data validation and data imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe quantitative and qualitative data in depth. Make a distinction between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Quantitative data are measures of values or counts and are expressed as numbers. Quantitative data are data about numeric variables (e.g. how many; how much; or how often). Qualitative data are measures of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a basic data collection that includes some sample records. Have at least one attribute from each of the machine learning data types.\n",

    "8. What are the various data pre-processing techniques? Explain dimensionality reduction and function selection in a few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Important Data Preprocessing Techniques:\n",
    "Data Cleaning.\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction.\n",
    "Feature Engineering.\n",
    "Sampling Data.\n",
    "Data Transformation.\n",
    "Imbalanced Data.\n",
    "While both methods are used for reducing the number of features in a dataset, there is an important difference. Feature selection is simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them. Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.i. What is the IQR? What criteria are used to assess it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.IQR is the range between the first and the third quartiles namely Q1 and Q3: IQR = Q3 – Q1. The data points which fall below Q1 – 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR are outliers.\n",
    "The interquartile range (IQR) measures the spread of the middle half of your data. It is the range for the middle 50% of your sample. Use the IQR to assess the variability where most of your values lie. Larger values indicate that the central portion of your data spread out further.\n",
    "\n",
    " ii. Describe the various components of a box plot in detail? When will the lower whisker    surpass the upper whisker in length? How can box plots be used to identify outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A box plot is a chart that shows data from a five-number summary including one of the measures of central tendency. \n",
    "Parts of Box Plots:\n",
    "Minimum: The minimum value in the given dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "First Quartile (Q1): The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of the dataset, which divides the given dataset into two equal parts. The median is considered as the second quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is the median of the upper half of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum: The maximum value in the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these five terms, the other terms used in the box plot are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR): The difference between the third quartile and first quartile is known as the interquartile range. (i.e.) IQR = Q3-Q1\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier: The data that falls on the far left or right side of the ordered data is tested to be the outliers. Generally, the outliers fall more than the specified distance from the first and third quartile. \n",
    "\n",
    "(i.e.) Outliers are greater than Q3+(1.5 . IQR) or less than Q1-(1.5 . IQR).\n",

    "10. Make brief notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "              1. Data collected at regular intervals\n",
    "              Ans.Interval data is measured along a numerical scale that has equal distances between adjacent values. These distances are called “intervals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "               2. The gap between the quartiles\n",
    "               Ans.The interquartile range or IQR is the range of the middle half of a set of data. It is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "               3. Use a cross-tab\n",
    "               Ans.Cross tabulation is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between multiple variables. Cross tabulations — also referred to as contingency tables or crosstabs — group variables together and enable researchers to understand the correlation between the different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a comparison between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data with nominal and ordinal values-Nominal data is classified without a natural order or rank, whereas ordinal data has a predetermined or natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Histogram and box plot-Histograms are a special kind of bar graph that shows a bar for a range of data values instead of a single value. A box plot is a data display that draws a box over a number line to show the interquartile range of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The average and median-The average is calculated by adding up all of the individual values and dividing this total by the number of observations. The median is calculated by taking the “middle” value, the value for which half of the observations are larger and half are smaller.\n"
