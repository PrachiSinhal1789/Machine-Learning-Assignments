    "1. What are the key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Collecting Data: As you know, machines initially learn from the data that you give them. \n",
    "Preparing the Data: After you have your data, you have to prepare it.\n",
    "Choosing a Model.\n",
    "Training the Model.\n",
    "Evaluating the Model.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning.\n",
    "Making Predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Most data can be categorized into 4 basic types from a Machine Learning perspective: numerical data, categorical data, time-series data, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "           1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes\n",
    "           Ans.A categorical variable is a variable with a set number of groups (gender, colors of the rainbow, brands of cereal), while a numeric variable is generally something that can be measured (height, weight, miles per hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction\n",
    "            Ans.While both methods are used for reducing the number of features in a dataset, there is an important difference. Feature selection is simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them. Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make quick notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. The histogram\n",
    "            Ans.A histogram is a display of statistical information that uses rectangles to show the frequency of data items in successive numerical intervals of equal size. In the most common form of histogram, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis and the dependent variable is plotted along the vertical axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "             2. Use a scatter plot\n",
    "             Ans.Scatter plots are used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis in the attempt to show how much one variable is affected by another.\n",
    "\n",
    "              3.PCA (Personal Computer Aid)\n",
    "              Ans.The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss. It helps to find the most significant features in a dataset and makes the data easy for plotting in 2D and 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why is it necessary to investigate data? Is there a discrepancy in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The motive behind data analysis in research is to present accurate and reliable data. As far as possible, avoid statistical errors, and find a way to deal with everyday challenges like outliers, missing data, data altering, data mining, or developing graphical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are â€˜bins'?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Bell-shaped: A bell-shaped picture,usually presents a normal distribution.\n",
    "Bimodal: A bimodal shape, shown below, has two peaks. This shape may show that the data has come from two different systems. If this shape occurs, the two sources should be separated and analyzed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewed right: Some histograms will show a skewed distribution to the right, as shown below. A distribution skewed to the right is said to be positively skewed. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the lower value cells (left side) and few in the upper value cells (right side). A skewed distribution can result when data is gathered from a system with has a boundary such as zero. In other words, all the collected data has values greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewed left: Some histograms will show a skewed distribution to the left, as shown below. A distribution skewed to the left is said to be negatively skewed. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the upper value cells (right side) and few in the lower value cells (left side). A skewed distribution can result when data is gathered from a system with a boundary such as 100. In other words, all the collected data has values less than 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform: A uniform distribution, as shown below, provides little information about the system. An example would be a state lottery, in which each class has about the same number of elements. It may describe a distribution which has several modes (peaks). If your histogram has this shape, check to see if several sources of variation have been combined. If so, analyze them separately. If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results. This could be as simple as changing the starting and ending points of the cells, or changing the number of cells. A uniform distribution often means that the number of classes is too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random: A random distribution, as shown below, has no apparent pattern. Like the uniform distribution, it may describe a distribution that has several modes (peaks). If your histogram has this shape, check to see if several sources of variation have been combined. If so, analyze them separately. If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results. This could be as simple as changing the starting and ending points of the cells, or changing the number of cells. A random distribution often means there are too many classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bin is one of the groups of values on the horizontal axis of the histogram. Unlike a bar chart, which puts gaps between bars to separate the categories, no gaps appear between the bars of a histogram unless there are actual gaps in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we deal with data outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.There are different approaches such as replacing the outlier with the mean value, or median value or in some cases dropping the observation with the suspected outlier so as to avoid any bias in them. We tend to delete the outlier if they are due to data entry errors caused due to human error, data processing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are the various central inclination measures? Why does mean vary too much from median in certain data sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.There are three main measures of central tendency: the mode, the median and the mean.\n",
    "Mean varies too much from median due to presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Describe how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate relationships. Is it possible to find outliers using a scatter plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.A scatterplot shows the relationship between two quantitative variables measured for the same individuals. The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. Each individual in the data appears as a point on the graph.\n",
    "If there is a regression line on a scatter plot, you can identify outliers. An outlier for a scatter plot is the point or points that are farthest from the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two variables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.To describe the relationship between two categorical variables, we use a special type of table called a cross-tabulation (or \"crosstab\" for short). In a cross-tabulation, the categories of one variable determine the rows of the table, and the categories of the other variable determine the columns.\n",
