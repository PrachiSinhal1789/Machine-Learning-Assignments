    "Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data.\tUnsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data.\n",
    "Supervised learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not.\tUnsupervised learning model does not take any feedback.\n",
    "Supervised learning model predicts the output.\tUnsupervised learning model finds the hidden patterns in data.\n",
    "In supervised learning, input data is provided to the model along with the output.\tIn unsupervised learning, only input data is provided to the model.\n",
    "The goal of supervised learning is to train the model so that it can predict the output when it is given new data.\tThe goal of unsupervised learning is to find the hidden patterns and useful insights from the unknown dataset.\n",
    "Supervised learning needs supervision to train the model.\tUnsupervised learning does not need any supervision to train the model.\n",
    "Supervised learning can be categorized in Classification and Regression problems.\tUnsupervised Learning can be classified in Clustering and Associations problems.\n",

    "Supervised learning is not close to true Artificial intelligence as in this, we first train the model for each data, and then only it can predict the correct output.\tUnsupervised learning is more close to the true Artificial Intelligence as it learns similarly as a child learns daily routine things by his experiences.\n",

    "         iv. Linear regression (simple)-\n",
    "         Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables they are considering, and the number of independent variables getting used. There are many names for a regression’s dependent variable.  It may be called an outcome variable, criterion variable, endogenous variable, or regressand.  The independent variables can be called exogenous variables, predictor variables, or regressors.\n",

    "11. Make a comparison between:-\n",
    "\n",
    "         1. Generalization and abstraction-\n",

    "\n",
    "          2. Learning that is guided and unsupervised-\n",
    "          Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself. \n",

    "          In Regression, the output variable must be of continuous nature or real value.\tIn Classification, the output variable must be a discrete value.\n",

    "Regression Algorithms are used with continuous data.\tClassification Algorithms are used with discrete data.\n",
    "In Regression, we try to find the best fit line, which can predict the output more accurately.\tIn Classification, we try to find the decision boundary, which can divide the dataset into different classes.\n",
    "Regression algorithms can be used to solve the regression problems such as Weather Prediction, House price prediction, etc.\tClassification Algorithms can be used to solve classification problems such as Identification of spam emails, Speech Recognition, Identification of cancer cells, etc.\n",
